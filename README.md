# Artificial Intelligence Notes

### Andrew's Research And Experimentation

- [Experiments with GPT-2](/GPT-2/overview.md) (generating conditional synthetic text)
- I built [a webapp](https://apps.golightlyplus.com/appropriate-photos/) using the [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) service to detect explicit or suggestive adult content.
- I created [a demo using style transfer](https://apps.golightlyplus.com/style-transfer/)
